&lt;p>I am a man who is easily distracted (clearly, it&amp;rsquo;s been six months since I last posted here). I like to experiment with things, and creating this blog was largely an experiment with Hugo and Docker. Here are a couple of notes about me:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>I dislike rich text editors&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I am not fond of HTML or CSS&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I like writing in Markdown; I think it&amp;rsquo;s efficient&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I like Git&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I like things that are free&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>If I was going to start a blog and update it with any regularity, I needed it to be dead simple. I wanted to write in Markdown, commit that Markdown to a repository, and have it magically turned into a webpageâ€”which is easier said than done, it seems. This is how I came across Hugo.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
